# Roadmap

## Planning
The package contains a spline correction method ("natural") that has
not been tested yet. This small point will be cleared soon.

At the moment, no future developments are planned. 

## Ideas
Some ideas might be to add a different currency (USD or JPY), or to
add a new interpolation method.

## Invitation
If you are
interested in the project and would require a future development,
don't hesitate to send a mail to RateHike@prophylaxis.be; the creator
of the package will happily assist you.
