This package was created as part of writing a master's thesis. The
master's thesis contains loads of useful information with respect to
the detailed workings of the package.  It was too big to be included
as a vignette, so I created this dummy vignette with a link to the
thesis:

[Multi-Curve Bootstrapping of Interest Rate Curves](/doc/masters-thesis-RateHike.pdf)
